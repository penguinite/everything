# everything

*Every nimble package ever... Now In one convenient package!*

`everything` is a nimble package that... well... depends on every nimble package out there!

## How do I use this?

Well, you might want to regenerate the nimble dependency list yourself! In which case, simply clone this repository, run `nim r gen_nimble.nim` and you're good to go!

Now run either `nimble test` or `nimble install` to download every package ever!
